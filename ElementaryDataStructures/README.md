##Elementary Data Structures Practice

All the code compiles. Run in VS. This was all done from memory so there may be slight bugs in the implementation, but the goal
here is to provide practice for me while prepping for interviews, and a point of reference for implementing data structures for others. This is not a repo that students should just copy and paste. This is also why I have omitted comments. Use the code for understanding, and then refine and tweak to fit your coding style.

Happy Coding!
