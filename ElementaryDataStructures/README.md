Elementary Data Structures Practice
All the code compiles. Run in VS. This was all done from memory so there may be slight bugs in the implemenation, but the goal
here is to provide a point of reference for implementing data structures, not to provide a repo that students can just copy and paste. This is also why I have omitted comments. Use the code for understanding, and then refine and tweak to fit your coding style.

Happy Coding!
